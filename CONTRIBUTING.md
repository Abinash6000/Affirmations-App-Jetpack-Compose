## Contribution Guidelines

- **Follow Code Standards**: We follow standard Android development best practices. Please ensure that your code follows these conventions (naming, commenting, etc.).
- **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Each commit should have a clear and concise description of what was changed.
- **Add Comments**: Be sure to comment your code where necessary, especially if it introduces complex logic.
- **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting a PR, ensure that your changes are properly tested and do not break any existing features.
- **Keep Pull Requests Small**: If possible, make small, manageable pull requests that focus on one feature or fix at a time. This makes the review process quicker and smoother.
- **Review Open Issues**: If you’re unsure where to start, check out the open issues and see if there's anything you can help with.
